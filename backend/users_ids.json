The application will feature an intelligent tutoring component that provides guidance, outlines, and resources for the projects. It will also allow students to collaboratively share and refine their ideas, fostering a community of learning and creativity. Technologies involved may include Python for backend development, React for frontend, and machine learning libraries for implementing generative AI capabilities. The project duration is 6 months, and collaboration will be conducted in a team of three."
