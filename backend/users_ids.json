The application will allow students to enter keywords related to their interests (e.g., AI, machine learning, etc.) and generate project suggestions. It will also include a collaborative brainstorming space where users can refine these ideas, share insights, and access resources related to their chosen topics. The system will be designed for users from various universities over a duration of 6 months. Key technologies will include Python for backend development, a suitable database for storing project ideas and user collaborations, and web development frameworks for the frontend. The expected outcome is an accessible platform that fosters innovation and creativity among students while addressing the challenges they face in selecting FYP topics."
